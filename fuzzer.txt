regex

re1='.*?'	# Non-greedy match on filler
re2='((?:[a-z][a-z\\.\\d\\-]+)\\.(?:[a-z][a-z\\-]+))(?![\\w\\.])'	# Fully Qualified Domain Name 1
re3='((?:[a-z][a-z]+))'	# Word 1

rg = re.compile(re1+re2+re3,re.IGNORECASE|re.DOTALL)
m = rg.search(txt)
if m:
    fqdn1=m.group(1)
    word1=m.group(2)
    print "("+fqdn1+")"+"("+word1+")"+"\n"
